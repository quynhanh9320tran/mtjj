# As more non-essential businesses except for bars, discos, and karaoke shops are allowed to reopen at full capacity in Ho Chi Minh City from Tuesday, the owners make sure that COVID-19 prevention and control measures are strictly applied.

Due to the complicated developments of the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities in the city previously required all beauty salons, karaoke shops, discos, pubs, bars, clubs, beer clubs, massage parlors, saunas, online game centers, wedding reception centers, caf√©s, theaters, cinemas, gyms, and other sports facilities to cease operations on February 9.
